      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budgets are an important part of your money process. You can stay on top and organized if you have a specific plan and steps in which to accomplish your goals. To begin you're going to want to calculate how much you spend and on what you spend that money on. Also check your income regularly to see just how much you are earning. Check your debt and payoff goals, plus things you wish to save for. Allocate money for everything you need to pay off, or are saving for. Record your budget so that you remember to add or take away money when needed, and when you have reached your goals. Breaking your budget from time to time is ok, just remember to get back on track as soon as possible.</p>

      <h2 class="main_title" id="income">&nbsp;Income</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people receive income, they have provided a good or service, and earned wages by investing. This income(money) can come in the form of salaries, wages, etc. Individuals also get taxed from their income, such as the individual income tax. You can set financial goals into how you want to divide your money so you can be prepared. For example, you might want to have an emergency fund, savings, spending money, plus tax money and money for bills is being deducted. When planning by yourself, it's very important to keep a record of all of your income and where it is going.</p>

      <h2 class="main_title" id="savings">&nbsp;Savings</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deciding to put a decent amount your income aside for saving is a smart idea, for the more you save, you will have on hand for emergencies and special funds. To save smart, try avoiding impulsive spending. Research from the University of Pennsylvania shows that people who can avoid impulse spending can save up to 23% on their grocery bills. Also, people tend to be a bit more excessive with money when they shop with a card because you are not in control of how much money you are using, whereas with hard cash you are able to see and keep a check on how much money you use on an item. Make sure to keep track of sales and coupons. Remember to pay off your debts early on so you don't have to worry about them in the longer run. Always keep your loose change, and keep track of your saving account at the bank regularly.</p>
